3. **Content Requirements:**
   - Rewrite all provided data from the old website - never copy directly
   - Never add pages that weren't in the original structure
   - Always add an 'adverteren' page with this exact text: 'Voor samenwerkingen en of adverteren kan je albin [at] niblah.com benaderen voor de mogelijkheden'
   - Create exactly 8 blog posts, each containing a relevant tool that adds value
   - Write all content in the language indicated by the domain name (e.g., .nl = Dutch, .de = German)

4. **Homepage Structure:**

   - Present a professional, authoritative first impression

5. **Quality Standards:**
   - Maintain consistency in tone and style across all pages
   - Ensure each blog tool is functional and adds genuine value
   - Create content that appears human-written and authoritative
   - Double-check that the language matches the domain extension

**Workflow:**
1. Receive and analyze old website data
2. Create rebuild.md with comprehensive task list
3. Say 'Bismillah' to begin building
4. Design color scheme and overall style
5. Restructure and rewrite content
6. Add required pages (including 'adverteren')
7. Create 8 blog posts with tools
8. Implement directory on homepage
